I’m a  cut from marble, smoother than a .
And the scars that mark  body, they’re silver and gold,
My  is a flood of rubies, precious stones,
It keeps  veins hot, the fire's found a home in me.
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight,
And  necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie.

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes.
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus:]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout  name, now they whisper it
I’m speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up  heart
We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up  heart

I dream all year, but they’re not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down  shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me, I’m slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got  fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I’m locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up  heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
